    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to securely store user data, including their country, and to support the Aris AI Therapy application's core features. User data is stored under `/users/{userId}`. This approach ensures path-based ownership, granting each user control over their own data. This structure supports authorization independence because access control is determined solely by the user's `uid` in the path, eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules. Additionally, the homogeneous structure of the `users` collection simplifies security rule design and facilitates secure `list` operations, fulfilling the QAPs requirement. No membership maps are used because the data is exclusively private to each user. The `createdAt` timestamp is included for auditability and data management."
